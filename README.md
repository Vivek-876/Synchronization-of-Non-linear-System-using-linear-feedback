# Synchronization-of-Non-linear-System-using-linear-feedback
We study the synchronization of 'm' coupled chaotic systems utilizing the
unidirectional linear error feedback scheme and derive a simple generic condition
for global chaos synchronization of more than two coupled chaotic systems using
the Lyapunov stability theory and Gerschgorin's theorem. This condition for chaos
synchronization is further expressed as a small number of algebraic inequalities,
making its verification incredibly simple.

Numerous effective methods have been developed as a result of a decade of research into chaos synchronization.
Due to its straightforward configuration and ease of implementation in
actual systems, the unidirectional linear error feedback coupling scheme is one of
the most effective techniques for chaos synchronization.
For the design of multiple responses (or slave) chaotic systems based on the
unidirectional linear error feedback method, the most important consideration is
the choice of the feedback gain (or coupling parameters)

This project studies the synchronization of 'm'- numbers of coupled chaotic
systems using the unidirectional linear error feedback scheme and derives a
simple generic condition for global chaos synchronization of more than two
coupled chaotic systems based on the Lyapunov stability theory and
Gerschgorin's theorem. This condition for chaos synchronization is expressed
as a small number of algebraic inequalities, making its verification incredibly
straightforward.
The approach involves consideration of a master system and m slave systems (s1,
s2, s3... sm). The generalization is being derived by considering s1 as a master system
and slave as s2, then s2 as master and s3 as a slave system till sm becomes the last
slave system by finding the coupling parameter for individual Master-slave
systems.
